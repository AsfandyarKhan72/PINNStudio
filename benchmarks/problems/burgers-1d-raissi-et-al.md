Exact equation, initial and boundary conditions as in [Raissi, Perdikaris & Karniadakis (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2018.10.045).

$$\Large \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{0.01}{\pi}\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}, \qquad x \in [-1, 1],\ t \in [0, 1]$$

- **Initial condition:** $u(x, 0) = -\sin(\pi x)$
- **Boundary conditions:** Dirichlet, $u = 0$ at both ends
- **Geometry:** Interval
- **In PINNStudio:** Examples → **Forward** (or **Inverse**) → **Burgers 1D – Raissi et al.**

A shock forms near $x = 0$ as $t \to 1$; this template uses a larger fixed collocation count to resolve it rather than adaptive refinement.

*Inverse mode* — same template, switched to **Inverse**, jointly recovering both coefficients of the data-driven-discovery form of this equation in [Raissi, Perdikaris & Karniadakis (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2018.10.045), Appendix B, eq. B.1.

$$\Large \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \lambda_1 u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} - \lambda_2\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = 0$$

with true values $\lambda_1 = 1.0$ and $\lambda_2 = 0.01/\pi$ (the template writes the viscous term as $\frac{\lambda_2}{\pi}\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}$, so the value it learns is 0.01). $\lambda_1$'s initial guess starts at $0.1$ rather than $1.0$, since $1.0$ is already its true value.
