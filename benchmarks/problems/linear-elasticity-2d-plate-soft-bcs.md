DeepXDE example: [`elasticity_plate.py`](https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde/blob/master/examples/pinn_forward/elasticity_plate.py)

$$\Large \frac{\partial \sigma_{xx}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \sigma_{xy}}{\partial y} = f_x, \qquad \frac{\partial \sigma_{xy}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \sigma_{yy}}{\partial y} = f_y$$

- **Boundary conditions as rows** (DeepXDE's `BC_type = \"soft\"`): $u_x = 0$ at top and bottom; $u_y = 0$ at left, bottom and right; $\sigma_{xx} = 0$ at left and right; $\sigma_{yy} = (\lambda + 2\mu)Q\sin(\pi x)$ at the top
- **Constants:** `lmbd = 1`, `mu = 0.5`, `Q = 4`
- **In PINNStudio:** Examples → **Forward** → **Linear elasticity 2D – plate, soft BCs**
